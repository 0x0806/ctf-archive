Chris was trying to hack our <a href='http://web.angstromctf.com:1340' target='_blank'>flag protection system</a>. He didn't get the flag, but he did manage to get this {{flag_locker.pcapng,PCAP}} of someone logging in, and a {{flag_locker.zip,redacted copy}} of the application source. Can you finish the job and get the flag?

`Use flagCheck to input the flag you get from the challenge to get the actual flag`
