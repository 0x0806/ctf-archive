This challenge is intended to test participants' problem-solving and inuition skills, as well as public search skills. The intended difficulty is easy.

I saw this cool vehicle while traveling around India. Unfortunately, I lost most of the image. This is all I have! Can you find the phone number of whomever manages this vehicle so I can contact them? DO NOT MAKE ANY CALLS Flag Format: csawctf{PhoneNumber} Replace spaces with dashes. Include the + and country code. If you DM the challenge creator (levu12 on Discord) with the original video link this image comes from, you will get a small amount of bonus points.
