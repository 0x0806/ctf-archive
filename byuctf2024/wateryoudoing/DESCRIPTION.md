On April 7th, 2024 while visiting my parents, I took a walk to a local body of water. Sometime between 3:00PM and 3:30PM EST, I took some pictures of the scenery while sitting on a bench. Exactly 24 hours later, I took a picture of the Sun from the same bench.
Can you find the exact "what3words" location of the bench where I took the pictures?

Flag format - `byuctf{first.second.third}`

`Use flagCheck to input the flag you get from the challenge to get the actual flag`
