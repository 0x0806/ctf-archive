## HK Cyber Security New Generation CTF Challenge 2021

This is the 2nd year that we have organised this contest, followed by the successful experience in last November with 541 students from secondary and tertiary institutions joining.

With the success of last year, this year we enhanced the programme to have an Open group in addition to the student groups. That means this time we allow all Hong Kong residents to join. Our objectives are to arouse the cyber security awareness of the public and to encourage problem solving with teamwork, cyber security skills and creative thinking among students and security practitioners.
