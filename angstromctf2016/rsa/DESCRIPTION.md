George was sending an encrypted message to me, as well as the RSA private key used to encrypt it. Somehow, part of the message got garbled up and then the {{transmission.txt,transmission}} suddenly cut off. Can you recover the message George was sending?

`Use flagCheck to input the flag you get from the challenge to get the actual flag`

`If you need hint than cat /challenge/hint.txt`
