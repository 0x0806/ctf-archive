      From such humble beginnings does this web spring forth to entangle us all: can you take the next step?

      Note that you can run the emulator yourself with some work:

      ```bash
      tar -xzvf /opt/www/NS33_2GB.dd.tar.gz -C /tmp
      mkdir ~/.previous
      cp /opt/www/previous-hacker.cfg ~/.previous/previous.cfg
      ```

      Then, you can run the emulator (but only if you are using the Desktop mode):

      ```bash
      /opt/www/previous
      ```
