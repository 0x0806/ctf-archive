Well, this is embarassing...
I've accidentally compiled 999 ELF files with my password somewhere along the line, one character at a time.

Solve these in order, each accepting one ASCII character.
Keep going...eventually combining these solutions will match the regular expression RITSEC\{.*\}

Good luck, and thanks for the help!
