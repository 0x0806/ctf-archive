`Beware: This challenge cannot be solved on pwn.college majorly becuase of the space requerments for the kernelcache but it is still available.`
  
This must be the simplest kernel pwn challenge here, I promise you.

**Please pack your exploit into a regular and installable IPA file. And open a ticket to start challenge.** You will have 10 minutes to pwn the challenge. During the attempt, you can request any form of restart or environment reset.

**Note:** Flag is in `/var/jb/var/root/flag` with `-r--------  1 root   wheel`. 

>We use an iPhone 8 with iOS 16.0 for this challenge.   
<b>Several well-known 1-days have been patched. </b>  
We highly recommend you test your exploitation on jailbroken devices or Corellium or any emulators like t8030-qemu / D22-QEMU first.   
Feel free to ask admin for debug device in case you want to test your proof-of-concept.

`Editors Note`

Since the challenge is not downloaded on pwn.college so this challenge doesn't have anything.

Although I did include the `pzb` source files just in case you can't find them

`Note: This challenge was not solved during the CTF and we would appreciate any writeups`
