You recently heard a {{mixed.wav,performance}} of Beethoven's &pi;th Piano Concerto, the &quot;Flag Concerto&quot;. As it turns out, this virtuosic piece actually contains a hidden musical message. Can you seek it out and find the flag?

`Use flagCheck to input the flag you get from the challenge to get the actual flag`

`If you need hint than cat /challenge/hint.txt`
