# REHOSTING

Files can be found here: [HKCERTCTF 2022](https://github.com/hkcert-ctf/CTF-Challenges/tree/main/CTF-2022/02-king-of-rps)

## Challenge Setup
This challenge has dependecy files already provided like `game_pb2.py`, `game.proto` so the `chall.py` file should work without any issues if you have them in the same folder.

## Flag
I changed how the challenge gets the flag from environment to opening up the `pwn.college` flag.
