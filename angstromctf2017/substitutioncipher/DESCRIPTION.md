We have discovered [some ciphertext]({{ ciphertext.txt }}). We need you to find the plaintext. **The flag is in the {flag} format**, not the actf{flag} format. There are no spaces in flag.

`Use flagCheck to input the flag you get from the challenge to get the actual flag`

`If you need hint than cat /challenge/hint.txt`
